This is a project from The Odin Project's HTML Foundations.
I will be creating a website consisting of HTML to cement what I've
learned from the last few lessons. The main page will consist of several links
to recipes of my own choosing. These links will bring you to an image, description,
ingredient list, as well as instructions.
