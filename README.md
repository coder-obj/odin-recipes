This is the recipe project from the HTML Foundations portion of The Odin Project. The aim is to demonstrate my
knowledge of basic HTML and to familiarize myself with the Git workflow through the command line.

Some thoughts with this project:

1. After utilizing the command line many times (in and out of VSCode), I am comfortable with the Git workflow.
   I am still learning when and how often to commit, but I am sure that skill will build up as I delve further
   into TOP.
2. It was so cool seeing all the changes on my GitHub repos. My profile seems much less daunting to navigate.
3. I was struggling a bit with the anchor links via relative paths and parent directories, but I understand them much
   better after reading Interneting is Hard's post on links and images. The visuals were a great help!
