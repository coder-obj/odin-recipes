                    <p>
                        Chicken katsu („ÉÅ„Ç≠„É≥„Ç´„ÉÑ) is made of chicken breast
                        fillets breaded with flour, egg, and Japanese panko
                        breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden brown. It's
                        the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork cutlet. With
                        just a few simple ingredients from your pantry, you can
                        make chicken katsu even on a weeknight!
