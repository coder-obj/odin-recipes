            Chicken katsu (チキンカツ) is made of chicken breast fillets breaded
            with flour, egg, and Japanese panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried
            until golden brown. It's the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork
            cutlet. With just a few simple ingredients from your pantry, you can
            make chicken katsu even on a weeknight!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch
                thickness
            </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place
                flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow
                dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess;
                dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated
                on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken
                in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per
                side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. /li>
