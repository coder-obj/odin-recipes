            Chicken katsu (チキンカツ) is made of chicken breast fillets breaded
            with flour, egg, and Japanese panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried
            until golden brown. It's the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork
            cutlet. With just a few simple ingredients from your pantry, you can
            make chicken katsu even on a weeknight!
