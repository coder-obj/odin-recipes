        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>One Bowl Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium sized mixing bowl, mash 3 – 4 bananas (about 1 1/2
                cups to 1 3/4 cups works well), add oil/applesauce and vanilla
                extract, mix again. Add the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking
                powder and salt, and mix well, but don’t overmix, just enough
                until the flour is combined. Batter will be slightly thick and a
                few lumps is ok. If mixture seems too thick, add milk,
                especially if using heavier flours such as whole wheat or whole
                spelt (you’re more inclined to need it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour batter into a greased loaf pan. Bake for about 50 min – 1
                hour. Ovens vary, mine usually takes 50 minutes. You can also do
                the toothpick test in the center of the loaf, if it comes out
                clean it should be ready. Remove from oven and let cool for 10
                min before slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Original Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium/large size bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking
                powder, baking soda and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, mash
                bananas. Add the oil, vanilla and bananas to the dry ingredients
                and mix until combined, do not overmix. If mixture seems too
                thick, add the almond milk (especially if using heavier flours
                such as whole wheat or whole spelt, you’re more inclined to need
                it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour batter into a greased loaf pan. Bake for about 50 min – 1
                hour. Ovens vary, mine usually takes 50 minutes. You can also do
                the toothpick test in the center of the loaf, if it comes out
                clean it should be ready. Remove from oven and let cool for 10
                min before slicing.
