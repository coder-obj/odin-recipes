        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Elephant ears are crispy circles of fried dough, also known as fry
            bread, coated with cinnamon and sugar. They are sold with this name
            in America at fairs, carnivals, food trucks, and theme parks. The
            uneven wrinkled somewhat round shape of the piece of fried dough is
            reminiscent of an elephant’s ear.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups self rising flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, <i>melted</i></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix together the self-rising flour, warm milk, melted butter,
                and granulated sugar until a ball forms. If your dough is too
                dry, add a tiny bit of additional milk at a time. If your dough
                is too wet, add a tiny bit of self-rising flour at a time. Cover
                with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn onto a floured surface and knead several times. Divide
                dough into 8 equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a thin
                circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet or
                heavy pot to 365˚F (use a thermometer and maintain an even
                temperature).
            </li>
            <li>
                Use tongs to carefully add dough rounds (1 or 2 depending on the
                size of your pan) to the hot oil. Fry for about 1 minute on each
                side until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain on a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar
                while warm.
            </li>
        </ol>
